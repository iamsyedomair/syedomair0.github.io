me :) 

Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am Omair, a junior at Saint Louis University dabbling in the world of Computer Science.

varying interests

I like to read and I read almost anything I get my hands on. suprisingly, still lots of good writers/thinkers living in this era. 

I have an interesting collection of monthly issues of wired magazines. 

Any form of humor and satire amuses me and any form it takes. blogs, podcasts, standup, news, thinkpeices, tweets... anything.

spend an unhealthy amount of time on twitter(sorry, X ðŸ™ƒ) and hackernews and substack

avid [music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOYfj180utAYl-hoi1nyRUB9qq2HfXBaQ&feature=share) fan... 

Always felt like I should also contribute to this ecosystem so here is my blog. 

will write a better bio soon. 

lots of interesting projects are in the pipeline once I am free of my internship, I shall get to them.
