hmm. why is it interesting? For me it becamse interesting because wherever you learn it, you do it in the context of the roman culture
and I find that historical section of the language very amusing so this is essentially a collection of things I find interesting 
in and about latin. Hopefully in writing this, the true essense of the language is revealed.

There is a this very peculiar sentence I'd like to begin with. 

Gramatically speaking, ***malo malo malo malo*** in Latin can be translated as ***I would rather in an apple tree than a naughty boy in
adversity*** in english. Just look at the economy Classical Latin holds in its homonymic craftsmanship. It's just so beautifully
confusing, right? but if we were to unwrap its parts and the context of the words and look at the common rules of Latin. How can 4 
identical words in a row can mean a completely new sentence that more or less makes sense ??? 

# the alphabets

similar to the english alphabet except it is missing **j**, **u**, and **w**. 

- There is no letter 'j' because j was a late addition to the alphabet made during the 
Renaissance in the romance languages like Italian, French, and Spanish to represent 
the "zh" sound.

- I can't find a good reason for u but the 'w' sound (w as in water) was not a native sound in latin
and it was represented as a combination of the letters VV (double V) in medieval Latin texts, resembles
the modern W.
