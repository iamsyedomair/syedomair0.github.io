# something I wrote during the pandemic lockdown

At first, the silence was quite friendly

not waking to the quarrel between the head chef and the sous chef

but realizing that I don't have the tiniest ability to cook

the imposter syndrome kicked in and once again I turn to what anyone
turns to when they don't know anything

looking at so much purple, I say to myself - there are only so many ways to cook an egg

The kitchen was the way it was left

every spoon, every jar waiting at thair battle stations

after all, cooking breakfast was nothing short of a war

with watery eyes, I bid adieu to the casualties as they retire to the dustbin

bittersweet moment after discovering the hundreth way to make eggs -- burnt.
