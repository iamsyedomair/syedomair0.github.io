# *Eggsploration: A Culinary Odyssey*

In friendly silence, the kitchen stood,
Unaware of the chefs' heated feud,
But as I stepped in, a truth unveiled,
My culinary skills utterly paled.

Imposter syndrome crept into my mind,
I turned to what most people find,
When lost in the realms of the unknown,
A refuge for the seeds unsown.

Amidst the purple hues arrayed,
I sighed, "There's only so much you can do," I said,
To cook an egg, a simple feat,
Yet now, it seemed like an impossible feat.

The kitchen waited, in a state of rest,
Every spoon, every jar at its post, the best,
Cooking breakfast, a battlefield indeed,
With each attempt, a new casualty freed.

Bidding farewell to the burnt mistakes,
My heart wavered, a mix of joys and aches,
Discovering the hundredth egg endeavor,
A bittersweet moment, a taste to remember.
