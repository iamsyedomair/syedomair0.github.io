What I reaaally want to understand are taxes. How do taxes work ? and what is this whole concept? 

may get a little long I'll add how much time it takes to read it all for me on the top. I'll add a few 
back-of-the envelope calculations as well so bear with me if they don't make sense they are just educated guesses.

first of all let me mention this interesting graph called the [laffer curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve).
