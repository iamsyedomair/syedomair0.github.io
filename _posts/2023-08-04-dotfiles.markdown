# My dotfiles

## Editors

I use the happy hacking color sceme and I use everywhere, from vim to vscode. 

I use vim plug for a lot of my vim plugins. some of the most notable helpful ones are

```vim
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
Plug 'godlygeek/tabular'
Plug 'preservim/vim-markdown'
Plug 'bhurlow/vim-parinfer'
Plug 'ryanoasis/vim-devicons'
Plug 'tiagofumo/vim-nerdtree-syntax-highlight'
Plug 'jiangmiao/auto-pairs'
Plug 'davidhalter/jedi-vim'
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
```

some more vim configs that make sense. 


```vim
syntax on
set ruler               " show the line and column number of the cursor
set formatoptions+=o    " Continue comment markers in new lines.
set textwidth=0         " Hard-wrap along lines as you type them.
set modeline            " Enable Mode Line
set linespace=0         " Set line-spacing to a minimum
set nojoinspaces        " Prevents inserting two spaces after punctuation on a join J

set splitbelow          " Horizontal split below current
set splitright          " Vertical split to the right of current

set number
set noswapfile
set hlsearch
set ignorecase

set autoindent
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set noexpandtab

set wrap linebreak

set backspace=indent,eol,start

set encoding=UTF-8

inoremap jk <ESC>
```

Tabs >>>>> Spaces

## Shell

I use zsh. actually I use oh-my-zsh.

I use the [oxide](https://github.com/dikiaap/dotfiles/blob/master/.oh-my-zsh/themes/oxide.zsh-theme) theme


## browswrs

I was an avid firefox fan but recently switched to chrome for its superior UI and its speed. still eats up a lot of ram tho

I have the clear cookies option every time I restart the browser which saves a ton of RAM and space.

I have Ublock origin adblocker. you should get it too. its free and I swear it saves you a lot of embarassment in front of people or when you are screen sharing.




...will add more later
