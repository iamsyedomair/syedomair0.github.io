hi everyone, my semester is going well so far. classes are going fine, 
liking latin a lot these days. Discussing the roman culture in the 
coming days and we have been asked to find topics about the roman culture
we want to talk about. Someone please help me out with this as I have no
idea about what is intersting from that period of time. midterms coming up.
not excited... 

but... interesting things happening in my research arena. I think I can 
finally get to fly the [drone](https://www.modalai.com/products/voxl-m500?variant=41019913764915)
now that it can be paired to the transmitter. I was dumb and couldn't find
the receiver on it and when I did I couldn't find the pair button for it
anyway... thats done. lets see how the test flight goes. 

But I was thiking... lets brainstorm some ideas I am considering for a semester project.
    - LLMs integrated into vision. 
        - for example: input: a video and a semantic description of something
          like "a 5'8 white male wearing a red hoodie and blue jeans" and the 
          program tags a match in the video.
        - probably need to learn something like stable diffusion
    - 3D reconstruction using drones
        - using NeRF or its many variants
        - run on a set of multiple GPUs to accelerate time
        - use tinygrad (experimentally) instead of pytorch to speed up things
    - secure distributed surveillance system with drones.
        - need to build a frontend
        - need to build a server for the drones to communicate
        - need to build a distrubuted system to distribute workload
          for applications like detection, 3d modeling, semantic segmentation

some october todos
    - finish the labs 
    - finish the fast.ai book part 1 and dive deeper into tinygrad codebase
    - top the kattiss school leaderboard... 🤙
    - write weekly...
