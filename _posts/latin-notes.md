# verb and nouns

well, we know what verbs and nouns are in plain english. They represent the same thing in Latin as well.

nouns in latin are divided into declensions and represents three things. The gender, number, 
and its case (what role it plays in the sentence).

nominative - the subject <br>
accusative - the direct object<br>
genetive - nouns that are "of" something else and to show posession.<br>
dative - nouns that are **to** or **for** something.<br>
ablative - nouns that are **by**, **with**, or **from** something<br>

The declensions table is the most intimidating but its just so beautifully logical that is simplifis a lot.
