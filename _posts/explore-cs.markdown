Someone asked me recently to help them with getting a broad overview of CS so they can choose what to do. I thought for a while and there were sooo many that I think it deserved to be written down.

tbh, first instinct, why??? ðŸ™ƒ. but it seems like a good idea for me to revisit this lane. I will add some resources and breadth first overview of CS according to me. Like all the skills needed and all the good quality learning resources for them. 

No geekforgeeks or cplusplus.com or any other website that has been seo'd to death ðŸ˜©. like seriously seo's need to chill. Hopefully the problem is solved in the next few years. but thats for another post
